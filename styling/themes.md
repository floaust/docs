# Themes

{% hint style="info" %}
You can customize the look of all PTerm printers at once by using themes!
{% endhint %}

## Default Theme

{% hint style="info" %}
Every printer uses the default theme. You can overwrite it to customize the look of all printers at once.
{% endhint %}

### Overwriting The Default Theme

{% hint style="info" %}
As every printer inherits from the default theme, you can change to look of your CLI by overwriting the default theme (`ThemeDefault`). All printers will automatically be updated.
{% endhint %}
